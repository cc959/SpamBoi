Do you have alzheimer fingers like mine, that are incapable of clicking faster then 5 times per second? Then this is perfect for you:
A minimal C++ autoclicker using Linux APIs, meant to run in the background at all times and be activated with a hotkey (preferably on a mouse).
Slightly randomizes click delay to be hard to detect by anticheat. (Use at your own risk though)
